# have a nice wee day

a web application that allows users to generate a dynamic single-page 'uplifting' scroller to share with others.  

## features

* simple user interface and experience
* different options to customise the look and feel of the scroller
* optional account creation to save and edit scrollers (a fake email address can be used)
* receivers can view by direct URL
* cute

## philosophy

for those who want to show others they care or are simply thinking of them. intended to sit somewhere in between an e-card and a surprise bouquet of flowers in thoughtfulness, a considered uplifting sentiment or pick me up, designed well, and communicated digitally.

## roadmap

have a nice wee day is currently in early stage development. a working MVP was deployed in April 2022. the M*L*P is due sometime in the summer of 2022.
