# have a nice wee day

a web application that allows users to generate a dynamic single-page 'uplifting' scroller to share with others.  

## features

* simple user interface and experience
* different options to customise the look and feel of the scroller
* optional account creation to save and edit scrollers (email address not required)
* receivers can view either by direct URL or entering a code
* cute

## philosophy

for those who want to show others they care or are simply thinking of them. intended to sit somewhere in between an e-card and a surprise bouquet of flowers in thoughtfulness, a considered uplifting sentiment or pick me up, designed well, and communicated digitally.

## roadmap

the uplifting scroller project is currently in early stage development. a working MVP should be available by May 2022.
